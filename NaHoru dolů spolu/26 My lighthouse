    <lyrics><![CDATA[
[V1]
In my wrestling and in my doubts,
in my failures You won't walk out.
Your great love will lead me through.
You are the peace in my troubled sea,
You are the peace in my troubled sea.

[V2]
In the silence, You won't let go,
in the questions, Your truth will hold.
Your great love will lead me through.
You are the peace in my troubled sea,
You are the peace in my troubled sea.

[C]
My lighthouse, my lighthouse
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You
My lighthouse, my lighthouse
I will trust the promise.
You will carry me safe to shore,
safe to shore,
safe to shora,
safe to shore.

[V3]
I won't fear what tomorrow brings,
with each morning I'll rise and sing.
My God's love will lead me through.
You are the peace in my troubled sea,
You are the peace in my troubled sea.
Bridge (4x):
Fire before us, You're the brightest,
You will lead us through the storms.
